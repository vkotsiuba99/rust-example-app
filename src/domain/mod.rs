/*!
Domain modules.

The domain contains modules for entities like products and customers as well as some shared infrastructure.
Entity submodules are organised around a single entity, or group of closely related entities, and their storage.
The public API contains entities, queries and commands that can depend on private storage.

Organising entities this way means we don't need a leaky public API for the sake of storage.
Cross-cutting concerns should either live in the most specific entity submodule, or go in a new one.
We shouldn't get too attached to the current structure, new information might mean moving things around.
