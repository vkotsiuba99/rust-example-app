Resolver for the domain.

The goal of the resolver is to let consumers construct components without having to know what their dependencies are.

The `Resolver` type wraps resolvers from other modules.
Private implementation details live on the wrapped resolvers.
Commands and queries are resolved from this `Resolver`.
