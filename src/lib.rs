/*!
An example Rust web application.

The project is split into two main parts:

- `app`: the rocket web application where the app is configured and hosted
- `domain`: the business domain where the app logic is defined

Most of the `domain` module is `pub(restricted)`, so these docs only show the items that can be consumed by the application.
Refer to the source for a fuller picture of what's in there.
